# -Log files are rotated weekly
# -Log files are rotated 52 times before being removed
# -Log files will be compressed
# -Log files compression will have a delay of one rotation cycle
# -Do not rotate the log if it is empty
# -If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without issuing an error message
# -Truncate the original log file to zero size in place after creating a copy,
#   instead of moving the old log file and optionally creating a new one.
#   It can be used when some program cannot be told to close its logfile
#   and thus might continue writing (appending) to the previous log file forever
#
#   **Note that there is a very small time slice between copying the file and
#   truncating it, so some logging data might be lost**
